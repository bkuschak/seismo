This code originally came from Larry Cochrane, from
http://www.seismicnet.com/software/ew2ws.zip on 07/02/2015

I made the following modifications:

- Ew2Ws now supports multiple WinSDR clients connected to it simultaneously.
- Fix dropped connections if WinSDR has ACK enabled
- Better debug and status reporting
- Removed obsolete and unused code and config file options

Tested against WinSDR 4.7.6 beta1 32 bit and Earthworm 7.7 on a BeagleBone Black.
